In this page we list the best practices when using Hiya Audio Intelligence APIs for
computing voiceprints and performing identity verifications.

## Model Selection

In order to provide the best result accuracy, is recommended that you
select the model that better fits your data. Please check the available
[Identity verification models][1] and [Voiceprint models][3].

## Authenticity Verification

Before computing a voiceprint, it's recommended that you verify the
voice samples authenticity. Please check the [audio verification guide][4].

## Audio retention period

We only store the audios for the configured amount for your space (by default 90 days).
During this period you will be able to access the audios using Hiya API and Console.
If you want to change this retention period, please check the [space configuration endpoint][2].
