Testing the Hiya Audio Intelligence APIs for accuracy and reliability, in your
specific use case, is key for assuring it's expected functioning and
requirement satisfaction.

In this page we provide guidelines and recommendations for testing the
platform, both for the voice authenticity and identity verifications.

<Tip>
  You can check the [batch testing script in the Hiya Github Examples][4]
  repository for quickly running authenticity verifications.

    ### Long-lived tokens
    You can create a Long-lived token for you application, which are designed
    for application to application communication. Check the
    [Bearer Tokens API Reference][1] for details.

    ### Score interpretation
    Check out the [Verification Thresholds][2] in order to get some idea on
    how to interpret the scores and model results.

    ### Audio variations
    You can test different audio formats and lengths. Check the [media file requirements][3]
    page for details.
