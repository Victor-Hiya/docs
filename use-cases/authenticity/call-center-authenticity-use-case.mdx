---

In this page we explain how you can integrate your Call Center Systems with
the Hiya voice verification service, in order to detect fraud, protect your client's
data and improve operational efficiency.

<Note>
  This is just a sample, meant to cover the general call center use case. You
  can tailor the use of our API to your exact needs!{" "}
</Note>

<Tip>Check the [Authenticity Best Practices page][5] for recommendations!</Tip>

# Architecture

You can use Hiya API to empower your call center productivity and security.
By promptly detecting synthetic voices, you can prevent fraud, protect your clients
and save valuable employee time.  
We provide insightful results near real time, so you can integrate the voice verification in
your existing call flow, taking immediate actions if necessary, like warning the agents or ending the call.

## Sample Call Flow Diagram

actor Clients
critical Call Establishment
    Clients ->> IVR: Start the call
    IVR -->>Clients: Ask for enquiry details
    Clients ->> IVR: Enquiry
    create participant Hiya
    IVR ->> Hiya: Audio
    destroy Hiya
    Hiya -->> IVR: Verification Result
option Voice is real
    IVR ->> Call Center System: Pass the call to the system
    actor Call Center Agent
    Call Center System ->> Call Center Agent: Forward the call to an agent
option Voice is fake
    IVR -x Clients: End the call
end
```

## Integration Steps

In order to use this functionality, you need to perform this three steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Record the voice">
    You need to have a record of the client call. This is usually accomplished
    via some voice protocol like SIPRec, and is also often required for legal
    compliance.
    <Note>
      We can process recordings of different quality and formats, please check
      the [media file requirements][1].
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the voice for verification">
    You can send the voice for verification using our API. Please check the
    [guide for performing an authenticity verification][2]. We will return the
    [verification scores and subscores][3], which provide insights of whether
    the voice is synthetic, replayed, etc.
    <Tip>
      Since [only few voice seconds are needed][6] for accurate results, you can
      reuse the existing IVR input you use for routing as verification.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the insights">
    Once you have all the relevant data, you can decide which actions to take
    based on your business logic. Please check the [verification thresholds
    page][4] for reference and recommendations on interpreting the results. This
    are some common immediate actions to take, if the voice is deemed not real:
    - Warn the call center agent of the suspected fraud, so that they can decide
    on how to proceed. - Alert the security team of the incident, for in depth
    analysis and Cyber Thread Intelligence. - Directly end the call.
  </Step>
</Steps>
