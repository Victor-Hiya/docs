title: Caller ID Use Case
icon: phone-plus
---

In this page we explain how you can integrate your Caller ID System with
the Hiya voice verification service, in order to protect your clients
from bot calls, identity fraud and advanced scam techniques.

<Note>
  This is just a sample, meant to cover the general Caller ID use case. You can
  tailor the use of our API to your exact needs!
</Note>

<Tip>Check the [Authenticity Best Practices page][5] for recommendations!</Tip>

# Architecture

You can use Hiya API to empower your Caller ID System security.
By promptly detecting synthetic voices, you can prevent fraud and
protect your clients against advanced actors.
We provide insightful results near real time, so you can integrate the voice verification in
your existing call flow, taking immediate actions if necessary, like warning the attacked client
and protecting other clients from the same actor.

You can integrate the voice verification service in different ways, depending on your needs:

## Integration Steps

In order to use this functionality, you need to perform this four steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Record the voice">
    You need to have the record of the client call.
    <Note>
      We can process recordings of different quality and formats, please check
      the [media file requirements][1].
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the voice for verification">
    You can send the voice for verification using our API. Please check the
    [guide for performing an authenticity verification][2]. We will return the
    [verification scores and subscores][3], which provide insights of whether
    the voice is synthetic, replayed, etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Properly Inform the User">
    Once you have all the relevant data, you can decide which actions to take
    based on your business logic. For instance, you could warn the user via a
    sound or GUI.
    <Note>
      Check the [verification thresholds page][4] for reference and
      recommendations on interpreting the results.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build the caller ID profile">
    You can use the verification data for building the caller ID profile and
    preventing future fraud.
    <Tip>
      Refer to the [List Chunks Endpoint][7] for detailed information about the
      moments when the audio is real or not.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
