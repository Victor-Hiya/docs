In this page we list the best practices when using Loccus AI Platform for
verifying the voice authenticity.

## Model Selection
In order to provide the best result accuracy, is recommended that you 
select the model that better fits your data. Please check the available
[Authenticity verification models][1].

## Audio duration
The minimum voice duration for optimal verification performance is **4s**.
With less than that we can provide results, but with less accuracy.
Going beyond **10s** there are diminishing returns.

## Audio retention period
We only store the audios for the configured amount for your space (by default 90 days).
During this period you will be able to access the audios using Loccus API and Console.
If you want to change this retention period, please check the [space configuration endpoint][2].
