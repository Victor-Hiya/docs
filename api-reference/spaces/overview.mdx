Spaces act as containers and keep speech data and results
bundled and isolated. They belong to either a [user][3]
or an [organization][4].

<Note>
  **Access:** To manage a space, it must either belong to [your user][2]
  or to one of your [organizations][4].

<Note>
  **Composite handle:** Spaces are tightly related to their owner and
  their handle is only unique in combination with them.

## Content

[Users][3] can upload and import speech data into a space.
The platform generates results by extracting and analyzing
characteristics of that data.
