Voiceprints belong to an [identity][4] and encapsulate the biometric
characteristics of their voice, extracted from some of their
[audios][3].

Once computed, they can be used to perform [identity verifications][5].

<Note>
  **Access:** To manage a voiceprint,
  you must have access to its [space][2].
</Note>

<Note>
  **Isolation:** A voiceprint can only interact with
  resources inside its [space][2].
</Note>

<Note>
  **Composite handle:** Voiceprints are tightly related to their identity
  and their handle is only unique in combination with them.

<Note>
  **Model:** The extraction of the biometric characteristics
  of the voice is powered by a specific version of a
  [voiceprint model][6].
