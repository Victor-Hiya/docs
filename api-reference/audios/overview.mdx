Audios are binary files containing speech fragments and their associated
relevant metadata. The person speaking on them can optionally be identified
by linking them to an [identity][2].

[Voiceprints][3] can be extracted out of them and different kinds of
[verifications][4] can be performed on them.

<Note>
  **Access:** To manage an audio, you must have access to its [space][1].
</Note>

<Note>
  **Isolation:** an audio can only interact
  with resources inside its [space][1].
