Credentials belong to [users][2] and allow them to sign into the platform,
creating temporary sessions. They consist of a handle and a password.

Sessions provide short-lived [bearer tokens][1], which in turn
can be used to authenticate API requests.

<Warning>
  **Expiration:** The bearer tokens associated with sessions are
  short-lived and will expire 24 hours after they are generated.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  To learn how to use the token of a session to
  authenticate your API requests, read the
  [bearer tokens][1] page.
</Tip>

<Note>**Access:** Only you can update your credentials.</Note>
