Users are the representation of human administrators on the platform.
They can become members of [organizations][2] and own [spaces][3].

<Tip>
  The endpoint specific to [your user][1] offers more functionality
  than the one generic to any user.
</Tip>

<Note>
  **Access:** To view a user, you must share an organization with them.
</Note>

<Info>
  Users must not be confused with [identities][5], which represent the
  people speaking on the [audios][4] uploaded to the platform.
