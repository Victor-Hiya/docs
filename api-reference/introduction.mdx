## Structure and access

Access to the resources on the platform is based on ownership,
which in turn is determined by the relationships between
the following resources.

## Speech data and results

[Users][2] can upload and import speech data into a [space][3].
The platform generates results by extracting and analyzing
characteristics of that data.

relationships and state of the currently existing resources
or through persistent records of the operations conducted.
