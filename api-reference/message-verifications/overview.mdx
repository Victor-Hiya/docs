openapi-schema: MessageVerification
---

Message verifications analyze the content of an [audio][2]
to validate that the message found matches the one expected.

They can be used for knowledge-based or possession-based access
control and to ensure that the audio is not pre-recorded.

<Tip>
  Message verifications can make recording-based spoofing
  attempts unfeasible in [identity][4] and [authenticity
  verifications][5] and introduce complementary authentication
  factors.
</Tip>

<Note>
  **Access:** To manage a verification,
  you must have access to its [space][1].
</Note>

<Note>
  **Isolation:** A verification can only interact with
  resources inside its [space][1].
</Note>

<Note>
  **Model:** The analysis and comparison of the messages
  found with the ones expected is powered by a specific version
  of a [message verification model][6].
</Note>

<Note>
  **Score:** Confidence in a positive result
  is represented by the [score][3].
