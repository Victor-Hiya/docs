Identities are the optional representation of the people speaking
on the [audios][3] uploaded to the platform. They can also
be used to create [voiceprints][4] and to perform
[identity verifications][5].

<Note>
  **Access:** To manage an identity, you must have access to its [space][2].
</Note>

<Note>
  **Isolation:** An identity can only interact with
  resources inside its [space][1].
</Note>

<Info>
  Identities must not be confused with [users][1], which represent human
  administrators on the platform.
