Usage statistics provide an aggregated and summarized view of the resources
inside a [space][3]. Unlike [usage records][4], they provide a
view of only the currently existing resources and are therefore
affected by deletions.

<Note>
  **Access:** To be able to view the usage statistics of a [space][3],
  it must either belong to [your user][1] or to one of your [organizations][2].
