Thresholds are used to make decisions based on verification scores.
They are not explicitly represented in the API because they are not
part of the results, but of their interpretation.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Binary thresholds">
    A common use-case is to block certain processes based on how
    a verification score compares against a simple binary threshold.

    **Example:** obtaining an identity verification score equal or
    higher to 0.6 might be a required step to authenticate a person
    against a given security system.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multilevel thresholds">
    Scores can be mapped to several possible outcomes
    by employing multiple thresholds.

    **Example:** a score between 0.4 and 0.7 might require additional
    security measures compared to one higher than 0.7.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Thresholds are implemented in the client systems to allow for maximum
  flexibility in the business logic that reacts to the outcome of the
  verifications performed.
</Note>

### Threshold selection

#### 0.5 threshold -- Balance point

Since a score of 0.5 represents an equal probability of a positive an a
negative result, it is the point of maximum uncertainty and the natural
choice for the threshold when the correct classification of positive and
negative audios are equally important.

<Tip>
  The 0.5 threshold is a good starting point when there is no clear bias
  towards security or usability.
</Tip>

#### Thresholds above 0.5 -- Higher security

Higher thresholds are more strict and increase system security at the
cost of usability.

- **Higher security:** less negative audios will be falsely accepted as positives.
- **Lower usability:** more positive audios will be falsely rejected as negatives.

#### Thresholds below 0.5 -- Higher usability

Lower thresholds are less strict and increase system usability at the
cost of security.

- **Higher usability:** less positive audios will be falsely rejected as negatives.
- **Lower security:** more negative audios will be falsely accepted as positives.

### Verification model accuracy

When a system has a strict requirement for either the False Acceptance Rate
(FAR) or the False Rejection Rate (FRR) the threshold must be selected
considering the overall accuracy of the [verification model][5], introducing
a bias towards security or usability to match the requirement.

  models. [Learn more][4].
