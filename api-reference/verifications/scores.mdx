Verification scores represent the confidence of a [verification
model][5] in a positive result, expressed as a probability. The
meaning of a score depends on the type of verification.

- **[Identity][2]:** the confidence in an identity match
  between audio and voiceprint.
- **[Authenticity][3]:** the confidence in the authenticity
  and liveliness of the speaker.
- **[Message][4]:** the confidence in the audio message
  matching the expected one.

## Subscores

[Authenticity verifications][3] offer a disaggregated view of the
different elements analyzed in the form of subscores. They are
also expressed as probabilities, with each representing the confidence
of the model in a positive result of a different aspect of the verification.

- **Synthetic:** the confidence in the non-sythentic nature of
  the speaker.
- **Replay:** the confidence in the audio not being pre-recorded and
  replayed.

## Score interpretation

Verification scores represent the probability of a positive result
according to a given model. Therefore, they are decimal numbers
ranging from 0 to 1 and can be intuitively interpreted.

For example, a score of 0.75 means that, according to the model,
there are 3 in 4 chances of a positive result for the audio
verified.

## Thresholds

Thresholds are used to make decisions based on verification scores. [Learn more][1].
