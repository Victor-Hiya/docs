openapi-schema: IdentityVerification
---

Identity verifications analyze the similarity between
the biometric characteristics of an [audio][2] and
those encapsulated by a [voiceprint][4] to validate that
they belong to the same [identity][3].

They can be used for biometric-based access control or to
validate that the voice of a media fragment belongs to a
certain speaker.

<Tip>
  Combining identity verifications with [authenticity][6] and
  [message verifications][7] can greatly improve robustness
  against spoofing attempts.
</Tip>

<Note>
  **Access:** To manage a verification,
  you must have access to its [space][1].
</Note>

<Note>
  **Isolation:** A verification can only interact with
  resources inside its [space][1].
</Note>

<Note>
  **Model:** The analysis and comparison of the biometric
  characteristics of the voice is powered by a specific version
  of an [identity verification model][8].
</Note>

<Note>
  **Score:** Confidence in a positive result
  is represented by the [score][5].
