title: Ids, handles and aliases
---

The API makes extensive use of three different types of fields to
identify and reference resources. Each one follows different rules
and is meant for different purposes.

## IDs

IDs are UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) and follow their
[standard format][1]. They are randomly generated by the platform
when a resource is created and cannot be changed.

Their purpose is to uniquely identify resources in an invariant
way so that the platform can keep track of them throughout their
whole lifetime. They are not intended to be used to interact
with the API and should only be referenced in debugging contexts.

**Example of an ID**

```
986b0cc0-e559-47a1-8226-bedf5002371f
```

## Handles

Handles are hyphen-separated lowercase alphanumeric characters,
following a [custom format][1]. They are usually user-specified
and can be changed at any time, although in some situations
they may default to the ID of the resource.

Their purpose is to uniquely identify resources in a human-friendly
way, while maintaining a restrictive, URL-friendly format.
They are the only valid way to reference resources in path and body
parameters.

**Example of a handle**

```
th1s-1s-a-handle
```

### Local and global handles

Although handles allow us to uniquely identify resources, some of
them are not globally unique and are instead local to a certain
context.

For example, two [API keys][2] may have the same handle
as long as they belong to different [users][3], each being
uniquely identifyable in its own context.

**Example of two API keys of different users with the same handle**

```
/users/alice/keys/main
/users/bob/keys/main
```

### Composite handles

Some resources are thightly related to a different resource but not
nested under it, in those cases composite handles are used to
uniquely identify resources.

For example, two [spaces][4] may have the same handle
as long as they belong to different [owners][3], each being
uniquely identifyable by their composite handle.

**Example of two spaces of different owners with the same handle**

```
/spaces/alice/poc
/spaces/bob/poc
```

## Aliases

Aliases are UTF-8 strings with no formatting restrictions.
They are optional, user-specified, and can be changed at any time.

Their purpose is to give users full control over how resources are
represented in UIs, and they do not uniquely identify resources.

**Example of an alias**

```
Thís îs an alïas! かっこいい!
