Most API requests must be properly authenticated in order to be accepted
and processed by the platform. Bearer tokens are used as a proof of
identity and must be passed through the [Authorization header][1]
in your HTTP requests.

```http
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```
Bearer tokens come in two flavours, each better suited for certain use cases.

<CardGroup cols={2}>

    Expire after some time, which currently is 24 hours.
    They are best suited for authenticating humans.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Long-lived tokens" icon="infinity">
    Do not expire, but can be revoked. They are best suited for
    service-to-service communication.
  </Card>

## Obtaining tokens

Different methods must be used to obtain the different kinds of tokens.
