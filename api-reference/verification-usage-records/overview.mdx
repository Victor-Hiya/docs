---

Verification usage records provide a persistent view of all the
[verification][3] performing operations conducted on the platform.

Unlike [usage statistics][4], they are not limited to the currently
existing resources and are therefore not affected by deletions.
Although their references will lose detail if they are deleted.

<Note>
  **Access:** To be able to view a usage record, it must
  either belong to [your user][1] or to one of your [organizations][2].
