Authenticity verifications analyze the authenticity and
liveliness of an [audio][2] to validate that the voice
belongs to a human speaking live.

They can be used to detect a variety of spoofing or spam
attempts, including the use of synthetic voices and the
playback of voice recordings.

<Tip>
  Combining authenticity verifications with [message
  verifications][4] can improve robustness against spoofing attempts.
