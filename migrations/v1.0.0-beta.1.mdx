title: Migration guide
---

Migrating from **v1.0.0-alpha.20** to **v1.0.0-beta.1**.

## Model information

Model information has been migrated from the API to the documentation.

The following endpoints are now deprecated:

  - `https://api.loccus.ai/models/voiceprint`
  - `https://api.loccus.ai/models/verification/identity`
  - `https://api.loccus.ai/models/verification/authenticity`
  - `https://api.loccus.ai/models/verification/message`

In their place, the new [model index](/models/introduction) should be used.

## Model selection

Keeping up to date with verification model versions is now handled
automatically by the API. Voiceprint model versions are still
explicitly selected.

When performing a verification, a model must be selected without
specifying the version. The only models currently available are
the `default` models, with more coming soon.

      ...
    }
    ```

### Creating a voiceprint

    Request

    ```json
    {
      ...,
      "model": {
        "handle": "default",

      ...,

      ...
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Handle suffixes

Previously, all the request fields referencing existing
resources had a  `Handle` suffix. Since handles
are the only valid way to reference resources,
these suffixes have been removed.

<Note>
  The API reference will continue to explicitly describe
  each of these fields as handles.
</Note>

### Resource reference fields

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="New">
    Request

    ```json
    {
      ...,
      "identity": "identity-a",
      "voiceprint": "voiceprint-a",
      "audio": "audio-a",
      ...
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Old">
    Request

    ```json
    {
      ...,
      "identityHandle": "identity-a",
      "voiceprintHandle": "voiceprint-a",
      "sampleHandle": "sample-a",
      ...
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Custom verbs syntax

Using colons to separate custom verbs from the rest of the
path is now mandatory. The new syntax was introduced in a
previous update and the old syntax is now deprecated.

### Actions with custom verbs

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="New">
    Path — `/resources/resource-a:verb`
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Old">
    Path — `/resources/resource-a/verb`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Database reset

The update from alpha to beta marks the last database reset
we will perform. All the API resources will be cleared when
the new version gets rolled out and the audio files
will be permanently deleted after 30 days.

<Warning>
  The database reset includes API keys and credentials.
  The original user and password shared must be used to
  sign in for the first time.
</Warning>
