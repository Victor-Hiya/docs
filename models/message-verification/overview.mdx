  <Tab title="Description">
    The **default** message verification model is the only
    message verification model currently available. It
    supports a wide range of languages and expects a single
    phrase.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Currently available version">
    [v2](/models/message-verification/default/v2)
    is the only version currently available and the previous
    ones have been deprecated, which does not impact in any way
    the verifications already performed with them.
